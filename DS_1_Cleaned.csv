(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; 
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. 
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. 
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.

(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; 
(b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; 
(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;

Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. 
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it. 
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.","Protection of Human Subjects, Subpart A- Basic HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (Common Rule), §46.116 General requirements for informed consent.
Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or its agents from liability for negligence.

Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. 
Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. 
2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology. 
3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.","Common Rule, Additional Protections for Children Involved as Subjects in Research, Subpart D, 45 C.F.R. 46.
§ 46.402 [Applicable] Definitions.
…
(a) Children are persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted.
(b) Assent means a child’s affirmative agreement to participate in research. Mere failure to object should not, absent affirmative agreement, be construed as assent.

(e) Guardian means an individual who is authorized under applicable State or local law to consent on behalf of a child to general medical care.
§ 46.408 Requirements for permission by parents or guardians and for assent by children. 
(a) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children, when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing assent. In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with the research. 
(b) … Where parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under §46.404 or §46.405. Where research is covered by §§46.406 and 46.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.

OMB M-17-12, VIII. Tracking and Documenting the Response to a Breach, pp. 34-35. 
…
The process for internally tracking each reported breach shall allow the agency to track and monitor the following: 
The total number of breaches reported over a given period of time; 
The status for each reported breach, including whether the agency's response to a breach is ongoing or has concluded; 
The number of individuals potentially affected by each reported breach; 
The types of information potentially compromised by each reported breach (see Appendix I of this Memorandum); 
Whether the agency, after assessing the risk of harm, provided notification to the individuals potentially affected by a breach;
Whether the agency, after considering how best to mitigate the identified risks, provided services to the individuals potentially affected by a breach; and,
Whether a breach was reported to US-CERT and/or Congress."
34,34. Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject,"1. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 
2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and the recommendations provided for in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3). 
3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met: 
(a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and that those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;
(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; 
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. 
4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.","OMB M-17-12, G. Notifying Individuals Potentially Affected by a Breach, pp. 29-30.
The SAOP, in coordination with the breach response team when applicable, is responsible for advising the head of the agency on whether and when to notify individuals potentially affected by a breach. Because each breach is fact-specific, the decision of whether or not to notify individuals will depend on the circumstances of the breach. When deciding whether or not to notify individuals potentially affected by a breach, agencies shall consider the assessed risk of harm conducted in accordance with Section VILE. of this Memorandum. The assessed risk of harm to individuals shall inform the agency's decision of whether or not to notify individuals. The head of the agency is ultimately responsible for making a final decision regarding whether to provide notification.
The agency's decision to offer guidance, take countermeasures, or provide services to individuals potentially affected by a breach may necessarily require the agency to notify those individuals both of the breach and of those steps taken to mitigate any identified risks. For example, if an agency decides to provide identity and credit monitoring to individuals potentially affected by a particular breach, the agency would need to notify those individuals so that they can use the service. However, agencies may also choose to notify individuals even when the agency is not providing a specific service. For example, an agency may notify individuals that their passwords were potentially compromised by a breach and offer guidance but no services.
Agencies should balance the need for transparency with concerns about over-notifying individuals. Notification may not always be helpful to the potentially affected individuals, and agencies should exercise care to evaluate the benefit of providing notice to individuals or notifying the public (see Section VIl.G.4. of this Memorandum).
Certain Federal information systems may be subject to other breach notification requirements, such as those subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The SAOP shall ensure that appropriate subject matter experts who can identify those requirements are part of the breach response team. In circumstances where multiple notification requirements apply to a breach, agencies should provide a single notice to potentially affected individuals that complies with the guidance in this Memorandum as well as any other notification requirements.
When the head of the agency determines that it is necessary to notify individuals potentially affected by a breach, the SAOP, in coordination with the breach response team when applicable, shall consider the following:
• Source of the Notification, including whom from the agency shall notify individuals potentially affected by a breach;
• Timeliness of the Notification, including the requirement to provide notification as expeditiously as practicable, without unreasonable delay;
• Contents of the Notification, including whether to draft different notifications for different populations potentially affected by a breach;
• Method of Notification, including the best method for providing notification depending on the circumstances of a breach; and,
• Special Considerations, including tailoring the notification for vulnerable populations, whether to provide notification to individuals other than those whose PII was potentially compromised, and how to notify individuals who are visually or hearing impaired.

35,35. Data protection impact assessment,"1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment. 
3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of: 
(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; 
(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or 
(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. 
4. The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68. 
5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board.
6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. 
7. The assessment shall contain at least: 
(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; 
(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; 
(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and 
(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.
8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. 
9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. 
10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. 
11. Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.","E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107–347.
